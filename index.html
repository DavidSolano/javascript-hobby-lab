                <h3>Introduction</h3>

                <p>
                    My hobby is rather simple, you can just play games. You can play
                    whatever genre you want and whatever amount of games you want.
                    There's RPG's and its related genres. Shooters and whatnot. Really,
                    if you can think of it its probably a game or there is one similar
                    to it.

                    <li>
                        <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/">Twitch</a> is our first resource for finding things
                        related to my hobby. In there you can find a myriad of people playing games. Games you
                        might never had heard of.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">Youtube</a> is basically another twitch except this time
                        you look up your game and again many people will have made videos about it. Reviews, tutorials
                        and whatnot. All that jazz.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/">Steam</a> is a store for pc games. Steam has store
                        wide sales every 3 months. Basically every season or major holiday. Although not going to lie
                        the sales lately haven't been great, but hey that's just my opinion.

        <p>
            It is quite easy to sink in hundreds upon hundreds of hours into video games.
            That's just a fact of life right there. No going around it. At some point you'll
            find a game you sink hours into. Maybe not like in a row, but over time those hours
            build up.
